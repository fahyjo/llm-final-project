Apply systematic optimization techniques such as:\n   - 2-opt or 3-opt local search\n   - Nearest neighbor with look-ahead\n   - Edge exchange optimization\n   - Consider node clustering patterns\n3. Calculate the total distance of your proposed route precisely\n\n## Requirements\n- Start and end at node 0\n- Visit each node exactly once before returning to node 0\n- Provide a route with a total distance lower than 1127\n- Your solution must be different from the previous routes\n\n## Output Format\nThink through your approach step by step, showing your calculations. Then provide your final solution in exactly this format:\n\n<trace>0,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X,0</trace>"
